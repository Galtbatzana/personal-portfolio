                            I'm passionate, <p className="underline inline-block">self-proclaned designer</p> who specialize in full stack
                            development (React.js & Node.js). I am very enthusiastic about bringing
                            the technical and visual aspects of digital products to life. User experience,
                            pixel perfect design, and writting clear, readable, highly performant code matter

                            I began my journey as a web developer in 2015, and since then, I've continued to
                            grow and evolve as a developer, taking on new challenges and learning the latest
                            technologies along the way. Now, in my early thirties, 7 years after starting my
                            web development journey. I'm building cutting-edge web applications using modern
                            technologies such as Next.js, TypeScript, Nest.js, Tailwindccss, Superbase and
                            much more.

                            free time. You can follow me on <p className="underline inline-block">Twitter</p> where I share techrelated bites and building
